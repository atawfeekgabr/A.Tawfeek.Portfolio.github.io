									<h3 class="major">Goal</h3>
									<p>The primary goal of this report is to extract actionable insights 
										from financial data to support decision-making, mitigate risks, optimize 
										performance, and drive strategic initiatives within an organization.
										Financial data analysis encompasses a wide range of techniques and methodologies 
										applied to various types of financial information, including income statements, 
										balance sheets, cash flow statements, and other financial metrics. Overall, 
										the goal of financial data analysis is to leverage financial information 
										effectively to support informed decision-making, drive operational excellence, 
										and enhance organizational performance and competitiveness in today's dynamic business environment.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Objectives</h3>
									<p>The primary objectives of financial data analysis include:<br/>
									<b>1-Budgeting and Forecasting:</b> Financial data analysis plays a crucial role 
										in budgeting and forecasting processes by providing insights into 
										revenue projections, expense trends, cash flow forecasts, and other 
										financial metrics. By analyzing historical trends and patterns, 
										organizations can develop accurate financial forecasts and allocate 
										resources effectively to achieve strategic objectives and business goals.<br/>
										
										<b>2-Cost Management:</b> Financial data analysis helps organizations identify and analyze 
										cost drivers, trends, and variances to better manage and control expenses. 
										By conducting cost-benefit analysis, break-even analysis, and variance analysis, 
										businesses can identify opportunities to reduce costs, improve operational efficiency, 
										and optimize resource allocation. <br/>

										<b>3- Risk Management:</b> Financial data analysis allows organizations to identify, assess, 
										and mitigate financial risks by analyzing factors such as market volatility,
										credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. By conducting risk assessments 
										and stress tests, businesses can proactively identify potential risks and develop 
										risk mitigation strategies to protect assets and ensure financial stability.<br/>

										<b>4- Investment Analysis:</b> Financial data analysis supports investment decision-making 
										by evaluating the financial viability and potential returns of investment opportunities. 
										Through techniques such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, net present value (NPV) 
										analysis, and return on investment (ROI) analysis, organizations can assess the profitability 
										and risk of investment projects and make informed investment decisions.<br/>

										<b>5- Financial Reporting and Compliance:</b> Financial data analysis is essential for preparing 
										accurate and timely financial reports in compliance with regulatory requirements and 
										accounting standards. By analyzing financial data and ensuring data integrity,
										organizations can produce reliable financial statements and disclosures that provide 
										transparency and accountability to stakeholders, including investors, regulators, and creditors.<br/>

										<b>6-Strategic Planning and Decision-Making:</b> Financial data analysis provides critical insights 
										and information to support strategic planning and decision-making at all levels of an organization. 
										By analyzing financial trends, market conditions, and competitive dynamics, businesses can identify 
										growth opportunities, evaluate strategic alternatives, and allocate resources strategically to achieve long-term objectives.<br/>

									<h3 class="major">Results</h3>
									<p>There is a strong positive correlation between budget amount and actual 
										spent amount represented by the equation: y = 0.89813x + 731.466 with 
										Maximum budget goes to Materials.  </p>
